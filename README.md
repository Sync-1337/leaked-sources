A cheat for Fortnite.

This cheat is detected by default on both anti-cheats run by Fortnite (BattleEye and EasyAntiCheat)
Some parts are already outdated, if you plan on updating this you'll need to update the signatures and offsets being used.
Everything is mostly calculated using UE4 functions like ProjectWorldLocationToScreen, LineOfSight, and GetBoneMatrix.

# Usage
This can be compiled with Visual Studio 2019, with the c++ tools installed.
Just inject the DLL when in lobby, and you should be good
